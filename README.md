# GKE-sample-project
Building and Versioning a Web Application Using Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub


# GKE Sample Project
Overview
This project demonstrates building and versioning a web application using Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub. The application consists of a frontend, a Python backend, and a database, all containerized and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.

Objectives
Develop a web application based on the provided architecture.

Deploy the application using Docker and Kubernetes.

Manage code versioning using GitHub.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, JavaScript

Backend: Python

Database: [SQL]

Containerization: Docker

Orchestration: Kubernetes

Version Control: GitHub

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Docker installed

Kubernetes installed (GKE setup)

Git installed

PyCharm installed

Setup Version Control
Initialize a Git repository:

bash

Copy
git init
Create a GitHub repository:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository.

Clone the repository:

bash

Copy
git clone https://github.com/donsebastian24/GKE-sample-project.git
cd GKE-sample-project
Develop the Frontend
Create HTML and JavaScript files:

Create a basic HTML page with forms.

Use JavaScript to handle form submission and data validation.

Enhance with CSS:

Add CSS for styling and make the form responsive.

Develop the Backend
Write a Python script:

Process data received from the frontend.

Connect to a database.

Add error handling and logging.

Containerization
Create Dockerfiles:

Create Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend.

Build and test Docker images:

bash

Copy
docker build -t frontend:latest frontend/
docker build -t backend:latest backend/
Kubernetes Deployment
Write Kubernetes YAML configurations:

Create YAML files for deployment and services.

Deploy to GKE:

bash

Copy
kubectl apply -f deployment/
Configure a Load Balancer:

Ensure traffic management.

Version Control Practices
Branching and Merging:

Practice branching for new features and bug fixes.

Use pull requests to merge changes to the main branch.

Commit Regularly:

Use meaningful commit messages.

Challenges
Document any challenges you encountered, particularly related to:

Version control (e.g., merge conflicts)
Code management (e.g., organizing Docker/Kubernetes files)

Screenshots/Demo
Include screenshots of the working application or a short demo video showing 
the frontend, backend, and Kubernetes deployment in action
